                        The details of my life are quite inconsequential... very well, where do I begin? My father
                        was a
                        relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a
                        penchant
                        for
                        buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My
                        father
                        would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the
                        question
                        mark.
                        Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the
                        genius
                        possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.
                        In
                        the
                        spring
                        we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with
                        reeds -
                        pretty
                        standard really.

                        Wait a minute, I think I may have lapsed into an old Austin Powers movie quote. The details
                        of my life are much less exciting. I was born and raised in IL. About two years ago I moved out
                        to
                        Arizona to be closer to family. In addition to working full time and starting this bootcamp, I
                        also just
                        got a new puppy a couple weeks ago. His name is Beau and he's a ten week old yellow lab. Before
                        this I
                        managed to finally keep a plant alive for more than a week so I like my odds on raising a puppy.
